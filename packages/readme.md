# Packages

Add your custom Composer packages here.

A [sample plugin](sample-plugin) is included so you can see the basic requirements.

## Steps

- Create new directory and `cd` into it.
- Run `composer init`.
  - Make sure there is a version number in `composer.json`. This is needed for Composer to resolve the dependency correctly.
- `composer require` your new package from the project directory.
